Thinking about a website builder.
Websites have sections (header, sidebar, main content, footer)
Each website section has content
- header: logo, nav items
- sidebar: internal links, featured content, ads
- main content: paragraphs, images, tables
- footer: contact info, internal links, disclaimer

Maybe we'll do a blog builder or something

A post is a composite component, except a post can't contain posts. Hmm.
