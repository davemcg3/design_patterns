# Site Builder
## Instructions
To spin this project up cd into the directory where it lives and then run:
`docker-compose up`
and then visit http://localhost/

There's a mostly hidden "Edit" button in the bottom right of the footer that will allow you to change the running page and get into the Edit functionality of the POC.

There's a pretty good explanation of what this project does on the page that comes up after running these instructions.

## Background

Thinking about a website builder.
Websites have sections (header, sidebar, main content, footer)
Each website section has content
- header: logo, nav items
- sidebar: internal links, featured content, ads
- main content: paragraphs, images, tables
- footer: contact info, internal links, disclaimer

Maybe we'll do a blog builder or something

A post is a composite component, except a post can't contain posts. Hmm.
